The result of running div_10_0.rbits is the following error:

ERROR: Max execute time reached.

This is a result of an infinite loop in the function, which is due to the 
lack of error checking. The error occurs because the remainder never changes
(since remainder - divisor = remainder - 0 = remainder). Thus, in every
run through of the loop, the condition that remainder >= divisor is satisfied,
since remainder is permanently equal to the dividend (in this case), so the
body of the loop keeps executing infinitely.
