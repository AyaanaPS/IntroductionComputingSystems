Description of the Stack:

1. 3                                           0x1008
2. Ret_Address (of main, which we don't know)  0x1004
3. Bp - Init (Old base pointer is pushed)      0x1000
4. 2 (arg at 0x1008 - 1)                       0x0ffc
5. Ret_Address 0x2030 (fact_resume)            0x0ff8
6. Bp-1 0x1000                                 0x0ff4
7. 1                                           0x0ff0
8. Ret_Address 0x2030 (fact_resume)            0x0fec
9. Bp-2 0x0ff4                                 0x0fe8
10. 0                                          0x0fe4
11. Ret_Address: 0x2030 (fact_resume)          0x0fe0
12. Bp-3 0x0fe8                                0x0fdc

Explanation: 

Line 1: Argument is stored onto the stack.
Line 2: Return address to go back to the main is pushed onto the stack.
    We do not know this return address.
Line 3: Bp-Init the old base pointer is pushed onto the stack, which is
    currently at 0x1000.
Line 4: We move to fact_continue and push arg-1 = 2 onto the stack.
Line 5: Call to fact pushes the next lines address (fact_resume) onto the stack.
Line 6: Back in the fact part, the old base pointer is pushed onto the stack.
    This is the base pointer at 0x1000 because previously, the current stack
    became the new base (movl %esp,%ebp)
Line 7: We move to fact_continue and push arg-1 = 1 onto the stack.
Line 8: Call to fact pushes the next lines address (fact_resume) onto the stack.
Line 9: Back in the fact part, the old base pointer is pushed onto the stack.
    This is the base pointer at 0x0ff4 because previously, the current stack
    became the new base.
Line 10: We move to fact_continue and push arg-1 = 0 onto the stack.
Line 11: Call to fact pushes the next lines address (fact_resume) onto the stack
Line 12: Back in the fact part, the old base pointer is pushed onto the stack.
    This is the base poitner at 0x0fe8 because previously, the current stack
    became the new base.

Nothing else is pushed to the stack because we now move into fact_resume and
fact_return, which don't push anything.
