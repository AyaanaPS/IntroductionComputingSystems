The getVolume function is located in the class of the object. In other words,
for some Shape object s, the getVolume function can be found by calling 
s->class->getVolume(s). The IA32 instructions must mimic this call.

The first thing to do is move the address of the object into a register. 
This is done with a simple move statement. The address of the object
is located at 8(%ebp) as stated in the question. (Line 23)

We then have to get the class of this object. In order to do this, we would
dereference the address of the object and get the first thing it points to,
because the class is the first thing in the struct. Thus, we can dereference
the register we moved the address of the object in. (Line 24)

We then have to dereference the address of the class in order to get the
getVolume function. We can do this by dereferencing the register that
we moved the address of the class into. We move this dereferenced register
into another register. (Line 25)

We can then call that register to call the function. (Line 26) 

IA32 Commands:

mov     8(%ebp), %edx
mov     (%edx), %ecx
mov     (%ecx), %edx
call    %edx
