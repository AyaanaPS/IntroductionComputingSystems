Problem 1: Cache Analysis

a) We know that in a 3GHz processor: 1 clock = 0.3 ns.
Therefore, the 3GHz processor can perform 3 billion instructions in 1 second.
Thus, it takes 1/3billion seconds to perform 1 instruction.
Meanwhile, the application can only perform 750 million instructions per second.
Thus, it takes 1/750million seconds to perform 1 instruction. 

Therefore, we can solve for the number of clocks by solving for x in the
following:

(1/(3 billion)) * x = 1/(750 million)
So, x = 4

We can then use a Hit Time of 1 clock and a Miss Penalty of 100 clocks.

Then, we can use the formula:

hit rate * hit time + miss rate * miss penalty = clocks

Thus, [(1-miss rate) * 1] + [miss rate * 100] = 4
Therefore, miss rate = 1/33 = 3.03%

b) Now, if we double the amount of instructions done by the application,
we can compute our new clock rate to be:

(1/(3 billion)) * x = 1(2 * 750 million)
So, x = 2

Then, like before, we can use a Hit Time of 1 clock and a Miss Penalty of
100 clocks and then plug in to the formula written above (line 19):

Thus, [(1 - miss rate) * 1] + [miss rate * 100] = 2
Therefore, miss rate = 1/99 = 1.01%
